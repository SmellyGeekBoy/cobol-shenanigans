# cobol-shenanigans
Just messing around with some COBOL like it's 1969. I'm a C# developer. I have no idea what I'm doing.

I'm using Micro Focus Visual COBOL for Visual Studio 2015:

That said, the .CBL files should work in any COBOL compiler (I guess?)

A lot of this stuff probably won't be mine...
